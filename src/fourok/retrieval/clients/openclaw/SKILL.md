# fourok Retrieval

Use the `fourok` CLI to retrieve permission-filtered, source-backed company context before answering.

## Commands

```bash
fourok status
fourok retrieve "<query>" --json
fourok open <source_ref>
fourok onboard
```

## Agent rule

When a question depends on company/project/customer/source context, call `fourok retrieve` before answering. If results look relevant, call `fourok open` on decisive `source_ref` values before detailed claims. Cite returned refs.

## Empty results

Say "No retrieved evidence matched" rather than claiming the fact does not exist. Check `fourok status` if setup or freshness may be the issue.

## Non-goals

This skill does not deploy or operate fourok. It assumes an existing fourok CLI/backend is available.
